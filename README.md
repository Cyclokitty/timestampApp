Cyclokitty's Magnificent Time Stamp Microservice
============================

My Project
------------

This returns to the user both the Unix time (all the seconds that have passed since January 1, 1970 to this very current moment).

All you have to do is add a date or a number into the url above and this will return to you the number of seconds that have passed since Jan 1, 1970 and a regular, readable current date.
